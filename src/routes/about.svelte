				I am computer RPG veteran and long time fan of the Baldur's Gate series. I started playing
				BG3 early in January and am totally hooked. I have spent close to a thousand hours on the
				original BG series, including a few hundred on hardcore, no-reload, solo runs. My website
				will house articles and guides on computer RPG's like Neverwinter Knights, Icewindale,
				Pillars of Eternity, and most importantly the Baldur's Gate series.
